Smart Librarian using RAG

I choosed to run a local Ollama server using gpt-oss:20b since I had problems with OpenAI API key.

The app takes the input of the user via text or speech which it transforms into text and the user decides to send it.

The user cand also choose the app to transform the response to speech via "Mute" and "Unmute" button.

It uses the basic Python GUI Tkinter.

Simply run gui.py to run the app and enter your prompts.

main.py was used for testing the prompts in the terminal.
